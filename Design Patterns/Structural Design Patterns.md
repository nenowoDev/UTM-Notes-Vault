- designing larger structure from existing class/object
-  focus on the composition and organization of classes and objects 
- to create larger, complex structures

Example :
- [[Adapter]]
- [[Composite]]
- [[Facade]]


| Pattern       | Desc                                            | Special Method/Class/Note                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Adapter]]   | adapt existing to new                           | Adapter implements existing, Adapter compose of new Class |
| [[Composite]] | whole-part relationship, tree                   | Parent/Leaf implements Interface                          |
| [[Facade]]    | minimal interface for complex process/subsystem |                                                           |
